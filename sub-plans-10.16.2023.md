# Sub Plans - 10.16.2023

### English 1 Sub Plans (3b & 4b)

Hello, all. Sorry that I'm not able to join you today (I'm sure you are also devastated about it).

In my absence, you will be completing an assignment on Formative that will teach you about characterization.

{% hint style="warning" %}
### &#x20;<mark style="background-color:orange;">A note about grouping</mark>&#x20;

You are allowed to work in **PAIRS** on this, if you would like. **No more than 2 people** can be in the same group.
{% endhint %}

#### Accessing the Assignment

1. Go to [https://app.formative.com/](https://app.formative.com/) and log in with Google, unless you're Kevin (yes, seriously; if you're Kevin, see my note below).
2. You should see an assignment posted that's called "STEAL Characterization - Lesson & Practice". Open it.
3. You will have the remainder of this period to finish the assignment.

Note that you are required to analyze **multiple** different characterizations for each of the four characters in the video.

You do not have any homework tonight.

**If you're Kevin, keep reading:**

_I think that when you signed up originally, you accidentally made a teacher account, which is why it's not letting me sync you to my roster. Before you can complete the assignment, you'll need to follow the steps below to delete your account and create a new one:_

1. Go [here](https://help.formative.com/en/articles/411771-deleting-or-restoring-accounts).
2. Follow the directions to delete a teacher account.
3. Use [this link](https://app.formative.com/join/NLFZUH) to join our class.
   1. If it asks you for a class code, ours is **NLFZUH**.
4. You should then be able to access the assignment the same as your classmates.
5. If, for some reason, none of that works, as a last resort, you can use [this link](https://app.formative.com/formatives/64ef217fe7a0539d62b5ca4e) to access the assignment without joining our class.
